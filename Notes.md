All Important Notes : 
=========================
1. Azure Resource groups are not nested.

2. As a best practice always assign roles to groups not individuals.

3. An Azure resource provider is a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service. We do not want the Help Desk to be able to have this capability, so it is being removed from the cloned role.
